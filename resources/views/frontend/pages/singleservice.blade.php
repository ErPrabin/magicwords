                        <h1><strong>Our Process</strong></h1>

                        <p><strong>The Web Design Briefing</strong></p>

                        <p>In this stage we develop scope-of-the-work by discussing and focusing on the clientâ€™s preferences
                            including layout, colors, fonts etc.</p>

                        <p><strong>Research</strong></p>

                        <p>We conduct research focused on the client's business&nbsp;itself, on its history, and on its
                            competitors.</p>

                        <p><strong>Reference</strong></p>

                        <p>We conduct research into designs that have been successful and current styles and trends in
                            relation to the design brief.</p>

                        <p><strong>Mock up</strong></p>

                        <p>We develop the design concept(s) around the brief and research findings.</p>

                        <p><strong>Reflection</strong></p>

                        <p>We set millstones to pause through the design process to take stock of our progress. This lets
                            our ideas mature and allow any correction before we move forward with renewed enthusiasm.</p>

                        <p><strong>Presentation</strong></p>

                        <p>In this final step, we then present the client with the final product.</p>
